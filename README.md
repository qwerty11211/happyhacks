# UnityFunds

Our world has become a vibrant mosaic of cultures and identities.  Despite our society's increasing globalisation and diversity, minority populations continue to confront numerous obstacles that form a complicated labyrinth that hinders their access to crucial resources and opportunities. UnityFunds tackles this issue head-on by harnessing the transformative potential of crowdfunding. 

## What it does
Imagine a society where one's destiny is not determined by skin tone, dialect, or zip code. A world where exceptional ideas can flourish because they have access to resources and support from all across the world.  This is the vision of UnityFunds, a crowdfunding platform fueled by the collective force of you and millions like you.

Crowdfunding leverages the force of the crowd—the combined strength of people who believe in a project's potential—instead of depending just on a single source of money, such as a company or a government grant. 

The minority communities are restricted by traditional financing sources because of their bias towards invisible lines. Minority-owned enterprises receive only 1% of venture financing, which stifles their aspirations before they have a chance to flourish. UnityFunds shatters these walls. We leverage the power of crowdfunding and blockchain to create a level playing field. This isn't just about money; it's about democratizing finance, where merit and community support fuel success.

Think of it as your personal Robin Hood, redistributing the wealth of opportunities to marginalized community

Since UnityFunds it based on blockchain, it was the following features:-
- Blockchain provides an immutable ledger. This means that once a transaction is recorded in the blockchain ecosystem, it cannot be tampered with. 
- This ensures the integrity of financial transactions on the crowdfunding platform, reducing the risk of fraud or manipulation.
- There is also enhanced security
- Lower transactional cost because banks are not involved

### How it works
- User logs into UnityFund their existing account or create a new one.
- In the dashboard, they are presented with a curated collection of diverse projects. 
- The user can click on any campaign that sparked interest in them. They explore its detailed page, including campaign description, goals, impact potential in the community etc
- They choose their funding amount and payment method (UPI or blockchain) and make the contribution
